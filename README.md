# Restaurants in Boston

This repo uses the google places API to get restaurants in Boston with data like rating, address, and rating count.

After the data is exported as a CSV, it is turned into an HTML file that allows for viewing of the table.

It is hosted here: <https://boston-restaurants.netlify.app/>

The table can be sorted in ascending or descending order by column by clicking on any table header.
